# Cone Deployment Robot 

## About this Project

This robot was built for the Engineering Design course AER201. The goal is to make a autonomous robot that can depoly traffic cones where there are holes and cracks. 

The robot is built with Arduino Unos and Nanos, DC motors, and servo motors. 

Since that this is an engineering design course, we do have journals and other planning that we did on paper. These unfortunately can't be put on the repository. However, we did include some stuff on here that we part of planning. They can be found in the 'planning-documentation' branch.

The software is written for Arduino (C++) and the UI uses C. The arm uses servo motors, and the drivers use DC motors.

## This repository includes:

* Source Code
  * The main code : *main_execute.ino*
  * Sensors : *tcs3200-lightsensor.ino*
  * Motion: *Drivers_Nano.ino*
  * Arm Movements: *PWM_Arm_positions*
* Gantt Chart : Planning the tasks to do overtime.
* PERT Chart: Identifying bottlenecks in project progress.
* AHP analysis: Choosing the best alternative for the prototype to be built (Including the code).
